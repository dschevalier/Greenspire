## Greenspire

To explore some of the updates going on with bootstrap I developed a simple single page site based around a fictional entity called Greenspire. The site was lacking content so I fleshed it out some with nonsensical ipsum from [socialgoodipsum.org](http://socialgoodipsum.org) and graphics from [smashicons.com](http://smashicons.com) to create a theme. Itâ€™s main purpose was for me to understand how bootstrap now utilizes flexbox and how it many differ in its component offerings from Bootstrap 3.
